# UI Data Visualization — Charts, Metrics & Dashboards

A decision engine for presenting quantitative data visually. Covers chart type selection, dashboard card patterns, and data-ink principles. For the layout of dashboards within a page, see `ui-layouts`. For using color in charts, see `ui-color`.

## 1. Before You Visualize: The Number Test

The most important data visualization decision is whether to visualize at all. A well-formatted number often communicates more clearly than a chart.

### When a Number Is Better Than a Chart

| Situation | Use a Number | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **One metric, one time period** | "$12,450" | The number is the answer; a chart adds nothing |
| **The user needs precise values** | "3,247 users" | Charts show patterns, not exact values |
| **Very limited space** (sidebar, mobile card) | "↑ 18%" | A tiny chart conveys nothing |
| **The trend is simple** (up, down, flat) | "$12,450 · ↑ 18%" | The arrow + number tells the full story |

### When a Chart Is Better Than a Number

| Situation | Use a Chart | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Showing change over time** | Line chart of revenue over 12 months | The shape of the line shows trend, seasonality, anomalies |
| **Comparing 3+ categories** | Bar chart of revenue by product line | A bar chart makes relative sizes instantly visible |
| **Showing distribution** | Histogram of customer order values | The shape of the distribution matters, not individual values |
| **Part-to-whole relationships** | Stacked bar or donut chart (carefully) | Shows both the total and how parts contribute |

### The Hybrid: Big Number + Sparkline

For dashboards, the most common pattern is a metric card that combines a big number with a small trend indicator:

```
Revenue (MTD)
$12,450
↑ 18% vs last month    [tiny sparkline showing the trend]
```

The number answers "what is it?" The sparkline answers "where is it going?" The percentage change answers "is that good?" This hybrid pattern does more work than either a number or a chart alone.

## 2. Chart Type Selection

### The Decision Tree

```
What question does the data answer?

Comparison: "Which categories are biggest/smallest?"
  ├─ 2-8 categories, simple comparison   → Horizontal Bar Chart
  ├─ 9+ categories                       → Horizontal Bar Chart (taller)
  ├─ Over time (e.g., monthly revenue)   → Vertical Bar Chart (Column)
  └─ Two variables (e.g., revenue vs cost per product) → Grouped Bar Chart

Change over time: "What's the trend?"
  ├─ One series (e.g., total revenue)    → Line Chart
  ├─ Multiple series (e.g., revenue by product line) → Multi-Line Chart
  ├─ Cumulative or stacked values        → Stacked Area Chart
  └─ Sparse or irregular time intervals  → Bar Chart (bars emphasize individual data points)

Distribution: "How is the data spread?"
  ├─ One variable                        → Histogram
  ├─ Two variables, relationship         → Scatter Plot / Bubble Chart
  └─ By category                         → Box Plot or Violin Plot (statistical audience)

Part-to-whole: "How do parts contribute to the total?"
  ├─ 2-4 categories                      → Stacked Bar Chart (horizontal)
  ├─ As percentages (but use sparingly)  → Donut Chart (max 4-5 segments)
  └─ Avoid                               → Pie Chart (hard to compare slices; donut is slightly better)

Progression/flow: "How do items move through stages?"
  ── Funnel or Sankey diagram
```

### Chart Type Details

#### Bar Charts

**Horizontal bar charts** are the workhorse. They're the easiest chart to read because labels are horizontal (natural reading direction) and bar length maps directly to value.

```
Product A  ████████████████████  $4,200
Product B  ████████████          $2,800
Product C  ██████                $1,500
Product D  ███                   $800
```

**Rules:**
- Start the axis at zero. Truncating the axis exaggerates differences and is misleading.
- Sort bars by value (largest to smallest) unless there's a natural order (months, categories with fixed sequence).
- Use horizontal bars when labels are long (> ~10 characters). Vertical bars compress labels.
- Gap between bars: 30-50% of bar width.

**Vertical bar charts (column charts)** are better for time-series data where the x-axis is naturally ordered (months, quarters, years).

#### Line Charts

Line charts are for continuous data over time. The slope of the line is the signal.

**Rules:**
- **One line is clearest.** Two or three lines can work if they're visually distinct (color, dash pattern). 4+ lines becomes spaghetti — consider small multiples (separate charts for each series).
- **Don't smooth the line excessively.** Slight smoothing is fine; heavy smoothing invents data between points.
- **Grid lines should be subtle.** Light gray, thin. The data should dominate, not the grid.
- **Y-axis doesn't always need to start at zero** for line charts (unlike bar charts). The line's shape — not the absolute bar length — carries the meaning, and slight variations can be important.

#### Pie & Donut Charts

**Avoid pie charts when possible.** Humans are bad at comparing angles and areas. A horizontal bar chart is almost always better.

**If you must use a donut/pie:**
- Maximum 4-5 segments. 6+ slices are impossible to compare.
- Sort segments by size (largest first, clockwise from 12 o'clock).
- Use a donut over a pie — the hole makes it slightly easier to read.
- Label segments directly rather than using a legend. Legends force eye-travel.
- Never use a pie chart for data that doesn't sum to 100%. Sounds obvious, but it happens.

## 3. Dashboard Card Patterns

### Metric Card (Big Number)

```
+----------------------------------+
| Revenue (MTD)                    |  ← Label
| $12,450                          |  ← Value (prominent)
| ↑ 18% vs last month              |  ← Change indicator
+----------------------------------+
```

**Components:**
1. **Label** — what is being measured, in muted text (12-13px)
2. **Value** — the number itself, prominent (24-32px, bold, primary text)
3. **Change indicator** — trend vs previous period (13-14px, green for positive, red for negative, with an arrow)

**Rules:**
- The label should be specific: "Revenue (MTD)" not "Revenue." The user shouldn't wonder what time period this covers.
- The change indicator needs a reference point: "vs last month" or "vs same period last year." "↑ 18%" without context is ambiguous.
- Don't show change for cumulative metrics where direction is always the same ("Total Users" always goes up).

### Metric Card with Sparkline

```
+----------------------------------+
| Revenue (MTD)                    |
| $12,450            ╱‾‾‾╲         |
| ↑ 18%          ╱‾╱     ╲___     |
|              ╱‾╱                |
+----------------------------------+
```

The sparkline shows the trend that produced the number. It's small, has no axes or labels, and communicates shape — not precise values. The sparkline answers "is the trend smooth or erratic? Up or down? Accelerating or decelerating?"

### Progress Card

```
+----------------------------------+
| Storage Used                     |
| ████████████░░░░░░  68%         |
| 6.8 GB of 10 GB                 |
+----------------------------------+
```

Use for metrics that approach a known maximum. The progress bar shows both current value and proximity to the limit.

### Top-N List

```
+----------------------------------+
| Top Products              [View] |
|                                  |
| 1. Enterprise Plan    $8,200     |
| 2. Pro Plan           $3,400     |
| 3. Basic Plan         $850       |
+----------------------------------+
```

A ranked list of the top N items by a metric. Simpler than a full chart. Includes a link to the full detail view.

### Activity / Event Feed

```
+----------------------------------+
| Recent Activity          [View]  |
|                                  |
| ● Invoice #1234 paid     2m ago |
| ● User jane@ invited    10m ago |
| ● Project "API" created  1h ago |
+----------------------------------+
```

Chronological list of recent events. Each event has a timestamp and an entity link. Provides situational awareness without requiring the user to navigate.

## 4. Data-Ink Ratio (Tufte's Principle)

**Data-ink ratio = ink used to present data / total ink in the visualization**

Maximize the proportion of ink that represents data. Erase ink that doesn't.

### What to Remove

| Element | Keep or Remove |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Heavy grid lines** | Remove or make very subtle (light gray, 0.5px) |
| **Chart borders / frames** | Remove — the chart area doesn't need a box around it |
| **Background fills** | Remove — let the chart sit on the page background |
| **3D effects, gradients, shadows** | Remove — they distort perception of values |
| **Legend (when possible)** | Remove — label data directly instead |
| **Redundant axis labels** | Remove if the context makes them obvious (e.g., months on a time axis, clearly labeled in the chart title) |
| **Decorative illustrations** | Remove from data displays |

### What to Keep or Add

| Element | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Clear axis labels with units** | "Revenue ($)" not "Revenue" — the user needs to know the unit |
| **Data labels on key points** | The most recent value, the peak, the target — label directly on the chart |
| **Title that answers a question** | "Revenue grew 18% in Q2" is better than "Revenue Over Time" |
| **Annotations for anomalies** | A dip in March with a note "Site outage (March 3-4)" explains what the data shows |

---

## 5. Color for Data

### Categorical Data (Comparing Categories)

Use distinct, equally-weighted colors. No color should appear more important than another.

```
Product A  ████████████████████  ← blue
Product B  ████████████          ← teal
Product C  ██████                ← green
Product D  ███                   ← amber
```

Use a categorical palette with colors that are visually distinct but equally prominent.

### Sequential Data (Low to High)

Use a single hue that varies in lightness. Darker = more. Lighter = less.

```
Revenue by Month:
Jan ░░  Feb ░░░  Mar ░░░░  Apr ░░░░░  May ░░░░░░  Jun ░░░░░░░
```

This is intuitive: darker bars represent larger values, which matches the visual weight.

### Diverging Data (Above/Below a Midpoint)

Use two hues diverging from a neutral center. Above the midpoint goes one direction (e.g., blue); below goes the other (e.g., red).

```
Variance from Target:
Product A  ████████  +12%  (blue)
Product B  ████      +5%   (blue)
Product C  ██        -3%   (red)
Product D  ██████    -8%   (red)
```

### Color Accessibility for Data

- **Don't rely on red/green alone** to communicate good/bad. Add arrows (↑↓), plus/minus signs, or text labels.
- **Use a colorblind-friendly palette.** Viridis, ColorBrewer, and IBM's design library all provide accessible palettes.
- **Test in grayscale.** If the chart still communicates meaning when desaturated, it passes.

---

## 6. Time-Series Best Practices

### Time Axis

- **Consistent intervals.** Don't skip months or compress weekends unevenly.
- **Label at natural boundaries.** First of each month, every Monday, etc. Don't crowd the axis with every data point.
- **Format dates consistently.** "Jan 2026" or "2026-01" — pick one format and use it everywhere.

### Comparison Periods

When showing a metric over time, always give the user a way to compare:

- **vs previous period:** Compare this month to last month
- **vs same period last year:** Compare January 2026 to January 2025 (removes seasonality)
- **vs target:** Compare actual to goal/target

"Revenue is $12,450" is a fact. "Revenue is $12,450 — up 18% vs last month and 12% above target" is information.

### Y-Axis

- **For bar/column charts:** Start at zero. Always.
- **For line charts:** Can start above zero if the variation is the story (e.g., stock price moving between $98-102). Label the axis clearly so the user knows it's truncated.
- **Label with units.** "Revenue ($)" or "Users (thousands)". The unit must be immediately clear.
- **Use concise number formatting.** "12.5K" not "12,450.00" for large numbers. "1.2M" not "1,234,567".

## 7. When NOT to Visualize

| Situation | Better Alternative |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2-3 data points** | Just write the numbers. A chart with three bars is a waste of space. |
| **Data changes rapidly** (real-time) | A live-updating number + directional indicator. Redrawing a chart 10×/second is expensive and unreadable. |
| **The values are nearly identical** | A table with exact values. A chart where all bars are 47-49 units tall shows nothing useful. |
| **The data needs precise lookup** | A table. Charts are for pattern recognition, not exact value retrieval. |
| **Very limited space** | A metric card (big number + trend arrow). A 100px-tall chart communicates nothing. |

---

## 8. Common Dashboard Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kitchen-sink dashboard** | Every metric the API provides gets a card | Curate. Only show metrics that drive decisions. "Total Users" might be interesting but if no one acts on it, remove it. |
| **Charts without context** | A line chart with no title, no units, no comparison | Every chart needs a clear question it answers. The title IS the answer. |
| **Equal-sized cards for unequal metrics** | The most important KPI is the same size as "Average Session Duration" | Size cards proportionally to importance. The top-left card should be the most important metric, and it should be visually prominent. |
| **Too many charts on one dashboard** | 12+ charts on a single page — the user can't process them all | 5-7 cards per dashboard is the sweet spot. Split into multiple focused dashboards if needed. |
| **Pie charts everywhere** | Default charting library choice | Replace with horizontal bar charts in 95% of cases. |
| **No drill-down** | Dashboard shows a number but clicking it does nothing | Every metric card should link to the detailed view where the user can explore the data. |

## Review Format (Required)

When reviewing data visualizations, you MUST use this structure:

1. **Current State Summary:** What data is being shown? What chart types are used? What questions do the visualizations answer?
2. **Finding → Recommendation Table:**

| # | Current | Issue | Recommendation | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Pie chart with 8 segments | Slices are indistinguishable; labels overlap | Horizontal bar chart sorted by value | Bar charts make comparison instant; pie charts with >5 segments fail |
| 2 | Chart titled "Revenue" | Title doesn't tell the user what to learn | "Revenue grew 18% in Q2, driven by Enterprise upgrades" | A chart title should answer the question the chart was built to answer |
| 3 | Dashboard with 14 equal-sized metric cards | No visual hierarchy; primary metrics don't stand out | Reduce to 5-7 cards; size top 2 cards larger; remove non-actionable metrics | A dashboard should surface decisions, not display every available metric |

3. **Ergonomic Rationale:** 2-4 sentences on the core data visualization principle driving these recommendations.
